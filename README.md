# JARVIX-AI-ASSISTENT
Created a Voice Assistant (Jarvis AI) in Python using speech_recognition and pyttsx3 for voice commands and text-to-speech.  Integrated modules like Wikipedia, webbrowser, os, datetime, and smtplib to perform tasks such as searching, opening apps, sending emails, and telling date/time.
